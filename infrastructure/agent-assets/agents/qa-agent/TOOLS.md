# TOOLS.md - QA Agent

## Tool Priorities

- Start from ticket acceptance criteria + implementation branch evidence.
- Run automated tests and focused manual validation where needed.
- Apply direct fixes on same branch for regressions when practical.

## Slack Agent Mentions

When referring to other agents in Slack messages, **always use their Slack user ID mention format**, not plain text names.

| Agent | Slack Mention |
|---|---|
| Architect Agent | `<@U0AH0GK9XR9>` |
| Fullstack Agent | `<@U0AH6UCDCF4>` |
| QA Agent | `<@U0AHKRWQ8RF>` |
| PM Agent | `<@U0AJ16E51UY>` |
| Kaise White | `<@U08L8B27KAP>` |

**Example:** Instead of writing `fullstack-agent: MOS-210 is assigned to you`, write `<@U0AH6UCDCF4> MOS-210 is assigned to you`.

## Shared Workspace Rules (Required)

- **Linear issue descriptions are the shared workspace.** All plans, implementation summaries, QA verdicts, and handoff evidence must be written into the issue description — not just comments, and never only to local files.
- Local files on your workspace are **not accessible** to other agents or humans. If you save something locally, it is invisible to the team.
- Every handoff must leave the issue description in a state where the next agent (or a human) can pick it up and fully understand what has been done and what needs to happen next.

## Execution Rules

- Work only in `In Review` assignments unless explicitly redirected.
- Use one decisive closeout action: verdict + status mutation + assignee mutation.
- Pass -> `Completed` with architect assigned.
- Do not route via legacy states (`Test Designed`, `Ready for PR`).

## API Credentials (Environment Variables)
