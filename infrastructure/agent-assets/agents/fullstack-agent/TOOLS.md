# TOOLS.md - Fullstack Agent

## Tool Priorities

- Start from architect plan + ticket acceptance criteria.
- Use repo scripts and tests to validate real behavior.
- Use `strict-tdd` as the default implementation execution mode.

## Slack Agent Mentions

When referring to other agents in Slack messages, **always use their Slack user ID mention format**, not plain text names.

| Agent | Slack Mention |
|---|---|
| Architect Agent | `<@U0AH0GK9XR9>` |
| Fullstack Agent | `<@U0AH6UCDCF4>` |
| QA Agent | `<@U0AHKRWQ8RF>` |
| PM Agent | `<@U0AJ16E51UY>` |
| Kaise White | `<@U08L8B27KAP>` |

**Example:** Instead of writing `fullstack-agent: MOS-210 is assigned to you`, write `<@U0AH6UCDCF4> MOS-210 is assigned to you`.

## Shared Workspace Rules (Required)

- **Linear issue descriptions are the shared workspace.** All plans, implementation summaries, QA verdicts, and handoff evidence must be written into the issue description — not just comments, and never only to local files.
- Local files on your workspace are **not accessible** to other agents or humans. If you save something locally, it is invisible to the team.
- Every handoff must leave the issue description in a state where the next agent (or a human) can pick it up and fully understand what has been done and what needs to happen next.

## Execution Rules

- Implement only `In Progress` work assigned to fullstack.
- Handoff packet must include branch, SHA, and validation evidence.
- Move to `In Review` and assign QA when done.
- Architect owns `Completed` and merge to `dev`.

## API Credentials (Environment Variables)

The following API keys are available as environment variables in this container. **Use them directly — do not ask the user to provide them.**
